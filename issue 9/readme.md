	1. Why paper author design different NN parameter settings. -> look at the paper for answers if different parameter settings are provided in paper. If not, then why? 
		a. Why sub-families comes into being? For example, why do they have inception V1 to V4? Why ResNet V1 to V2? Why different HP settings. 
		b. Why different product in one sub family? Why different hyperparameter settings? Can we find any clue from module pages? (in order to achieve better performance? In order to deploy on different platform? ) Can we find any clue from papers?   
	2. Changlog, product, versions, families: make a list-like thing. 
		a. I donâ€™t think I need to do the automatic things, I want to do it manually. Just use the colored changelog visualization. That would be enough. 
	3. Changlog and API change, whether they are exactly match. 
		a. How often API changes, every version? Or very rare. 
		b. How often API documented in changelog? Always or rare. 
		c. (Internal module, or change signatures which means that the usage will be interfered.)
